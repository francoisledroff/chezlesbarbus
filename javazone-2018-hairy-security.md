  Hairy Security: the many threats to one simple REST API

# Description:


It's getting dangerous out there, it's all over the news, IT security is simply no longer something one can ignore. 

In this session we'll model all of the threats to a very simple REST API; 
a simple REST API powered by a Java back-end. 

We’ll debate, but will also have fun, state the obvious and debunk a few security myths:

* Yes, strong security come at price, it requires a brain,
* No, strong security does not mean crappy user experience,
* No, there is no silver bullet, be pragmatic, 
* Yes, they are many standards and frameworks (saml, oauth, jwt, 2-way-ssl ...) 
  ** we'll showcase a few and debate when to choose what
* Yes, SELinux and the Java SecurityManager can be your friends
* Yes, Security needs to be baked into all your automation and continuous integration. Secret Management is key 


# Expected audience:


We expect you (the audience) to somewhat know how to implement an http service.
At the end of this session, you will know that it’s not a question of 'if' but 'when' your http endpoint will be hacked,  you'll be better armed and prepared, and you'll decide for yourself if it's really time for your simple REST API to go live !
