Beyond the Serverless Buzz : implementing "Function As A Service" with OpenWhisk

# Description:

Join us in this talk on OpenWhisk, we will have you explore the design of this "Open Source" polyglot functions-as-a-service (FaaS) programming platform, we will walk you through many code samples and demonstrations of applications using event-driven & serverless technologies.

# Expected audience:


We expect you (the audience) to somewhat know how to implement distributed/web services.
At the end of this session you shall see why serverless architectures can be attractive and why you should consider OpenWhisk for your next project.


# outline:

We will first have you explore the design of this "Open Source" polyglot functions-as-a-service (FaaS) programming platform, 

then we will walk you through code samples
live coding and plenty of demos

As Romain and I are both working for companies that committed to this serverless technology, we'll hopefully have plenty of interesting stories, associated code and use cases to share.
